### PyConUS 2024 Speaker ðŸŽ¤

I recently had the privilege of delivering a talk at PyConUS 2024 titled ["Enhancing Decorators with Type Annotations: Techniques and Best Practices"](https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/42/), where I shared insights on leveraging type annotations to enrich decorators effectively.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I am a software developer who enjoys contributing to Open Source Software (OSS) with a goal to make the development environment friendlier ðŸ˜„. 

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- The [`pydantic-pycharm-plugin`](https://github.com/koxudaxi/pydantic-pycharm-plugin) to enhance Pydantic support in PyCharm, featured on [JetBrains' PyCharm Blog](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2020/04/interview-koudai-aono-author-of-pydantic-plugin-for-pycharm/) ðŸŽ¤.
- [My poetry plugin](https://github.com/koxudaxi/poetry-pycharm-plugin) is now integrated into PyCharm from version 2021.3 onwards ðŸŽ‰ðŸ˜Ž.
  ðŸ‘‰[Whatâ€™s New in PyCharm 2021.3](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/whatsnew/2021-3/)
- The [`ruff-pycharm-plugin`](https://github.com/koxudaxi/ruff-pycharm-plugin) to aid Ruff application development within PyCharm.
- The [`datamodel-code-generator`](https://github.com/koxudaxi/datamodel-code-generator) for generating various models from different data sources.
   The output target models include:
    - `pydantic.BaseModel` (v1 and v2)
    - `dataclasses.dataclass`
    - `typing.TypedDict`
    - `msgspec.Struct`
